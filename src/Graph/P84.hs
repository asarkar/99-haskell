Problem 84: (**) Construct the minimal spanning trees.

ANSWER: We use Prim's eager MST algorithm.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq3ABa-px_g

- Maintain a min Indexed Priority Queue (IPQ) of size V
  that sorts vertex-edge pairs based on the min edge cost
  of e. By default, all vertices v have a best value of âˆž
  in the IPQ.

- Start the algorithm on any node 's'. Mark s as visited
  and relax all edges of s.
  Relaxing refers to updating the entry for node v in the
  IPQ from (v, old_edge) to (v, new_edge) if the new_edge
  from u -> v has a lower cost than old_edge.

- While the IPQ is not empty and a MST has not been formed,
  deque the next best (v, e) pair from the IPQ. Mark node v
  as visited and add edge e to the MST.

- Next, relax all edges of v while making sure not to relax
  any edge pointing to a node which has already been visited.

This algorithm runs in O(E log V) time since there can only
be V (node, edge) pairs in the IPQ, making the update and
poll operations O(log V).
