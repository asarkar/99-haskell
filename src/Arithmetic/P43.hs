Problem 43: (*) Gaussian integer divisibility.

A Gaussian integer is a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are integers.
If x and y are Gaussian integers where y /= 0, then x is said to be divisible by y if there
is a Guassian integer x such that x = yz.

Determine whether a Gaussian integer is divisible by another.

ANSWER: TODO.
