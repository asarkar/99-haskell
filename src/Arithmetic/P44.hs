Problem 44: (**) Gaussian primes.

A Gaussian integer x is said to be a Gaussian prime when it has no divisors except for the
units and associates of x. The units are 1, i - 1, and -i. The associates are defined by the
numbers obtained when x is multiplied by each unit.

Determine whether a Gaussian integer is a Gaussian prime.

ANSWER: TODO.
