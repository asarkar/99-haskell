Problem 38: (*) Compare the two methods of calculating Euler's totient function.

Use the solutions of Problems 34 and 37 to compare the algorithms.
Take the number of reductions as a measure for efficiency.
Try to calculate phi(10090) as an example.

ANSWER:
TODO. What's up with the obsession with Euler's totient function,
let's do something different FFS!
