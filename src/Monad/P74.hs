{-
Problem 74: (**) Monads without do notation.

We would like to implement a function which reads an even number from standard input,
finds two prime numbers which add up to the number (see Problem 40), and prints out the
equation to standard output.

Implement the function without do notation. In other words, use >>= or >> directly,
instead of using them implicitly through do notation.
Try to use these functions with prefix style instead of infix style.
