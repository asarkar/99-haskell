Problem 45: (*) Gaussian primes using the two-square theorem.

Using Fermat's two-square theorem, it can be shown that a Gaussian integer a + bi
is prime if and only if it falls into one of the following categories:

\|a| is prime and |𝑎| ≡ 3 mod 4, if 𝑏=0

\|b| is prime and |𝑏| ≡ 3 mod 4, if 𝑎=0

a^2 + b^2 is prime, if a /= 0 and b /= 0

Use this property to determine whether a Gaussian integer is a Gaussian prime.

ANSWER: TODO.
